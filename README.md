# Collect The Coins

Minimal implementation of a mini game. Based off the ["first 2D game" tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html) from the official Godot docs. This was just a way to exercise what I learned from the tutorial.

## How to play

Collect as many coins as you can before the timer runs out!

## TODOs/nice to have

- [ ] Host this somewhere so others can play.
- [ ] Coins don't seem to spawn reliably on every CoinTimer timeout.
- [ ] Coin spawn path seems to move with player position.
- [ ] Nicer art assets. I just used whatever was available from the tutorial.
- [ ] Add audio.
- [ ] Add auto-acceleration to player object, so that player has to steer.
- [ ] Make game end when player collides with the screen borders.
